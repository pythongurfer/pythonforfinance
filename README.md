### The Notebooks are broken down into the following sections:


* Simple Moving Averages: 
    It focuses on al algorithmic trading strategy based on simple moving averages and how to backtest such a strategy. 
* Random Walk Hypothesis: 
    This section introduces the random walk hypothesis. 
* Linear OLS Regression:
    This sections looks at using OLS regression do derive an algorithmic trading strategy. 
* Clustering: 
    We explore using unsupervised learning algorithms to derive algorithmic trading strategies. 
* Frequency Approach:
    We look at classification algorithms from machine learning for algorithmic trading
* Deep Neural Networks: 
    This section focuses on deep neural netwoks and how to use them for algorithmic trading
